    <h2><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></h2>
    <p>This here is a real doozy of a recipe. It's
       a nice old mid-western recipe that's as old as time. 
       This isn't from any fancy place mind you, not from 
       my grandma or great-grandmother. Nope. 
       I got it from allrecipes
    </p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>
        Because they have amazing recipes on there. They have
        <em>all</em> of the recipes. So why should we go on there?
        We must all assimilate to them. There can be no difference.
        For on earth, we are but fleeting bags of nothingness 
        into the voyage of space, with some potential meaning...
        <em>maybe<strong>!</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Sp put on your apron. Not just any apron, it has to be a frilly,
        flowery apron. Because I suppose that makes us more woman-like
        and we all know women make better food then us (us being men of course).
        This was essentially, all from someone I had absolute <em>pleasure</em>
        of speaking with at my place of work yesterday. Truly an outstanding citizen
        and surely doesn't have any issue with self-esteem.

    <p>
        Without further ado, please enjoy.
